The "My-Cornell- Portfolio" showcases the major projects and large language models that I have implemented while completing a machine learning engineering internship at Cornell University's Graduate School of Technology.
During the internship, I recieved my certification in machine learning foundations and then worked as a financial engineering intern and contributed to an LLM for transaction matching a financial dataset.
Then, during the spring I worked on a computer vision model for the New York Botanical Garden that classified plant specimen images. 
I have included the code for both projects as well as smaller machine learning projects I have completed in this repository!
